Caltech CS2 Assignment 9: Othello

This AI was written in Java as an included AI and does not use the wrapper classes.
Because of this, this AI will only work with this JAR, and the JAR must be recompiled
after any edit that occurs to the AI.

To test this code, just do:
	make cleanjava
	make java
	./testgame TheRealSlimShady [other_player]
		or
	./testgame [other_player] TheRealSlimShady
